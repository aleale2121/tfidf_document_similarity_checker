Like other Saturday, Master Rick of the Seattle Zen Monastery asked me to sweep the courtyard with a brittle straw broom. This week was more than the usual load: pigeons had left their excrement over the courtyard–which meant I had to mop up their mess after sweeping. Despite this extra work, the words of Master Rick–a tall, straw-thin man in his 60s–echoed in my mind: “Sweep like you are sweeping your thoughts away–one at a time.” I wasn’t sure if it was a mystical statement or just an excuse to get a 17-year-old to do his chores. But it didn’t matter what I thought: I had to do my duty and that was the end of it.
